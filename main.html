        <h2>Who I am</h2>
        <p>
            Hello world! My name is Grégory, I am a French IT engineering student at CESI Bordeaux Engineering school.
            I am currently in the fourth year of my course, and I expect to join the software dominant course.
            My first experience with IT was some Arduino project that is available on my GitHub page.
            I have really enjoyed this experience, so I wanted to keep going with programing.
            Currently, I am still working on different projects in order to get experiences and know in which IT
            department I want to work.
        </p>

        <h2>What I want to be</h2>
        <p>
            A SOFTWARE ENGINEER ! That is what I first wanted to be. In 5 years, I would like to have enough knowledge
            to be able to work as a Fullstack developer, a software desktop, mobile and web developer,
            an AR/VR developer and maybe even a game developer !
            As you can see with what I have just written, I am a versatile individual, and that is true,
            I like versatility, and I want it to be my main strength during my career.
